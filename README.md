# ForGifAboutIt

This site displays a list of popular series as buttons which will generate 10 gifs and display them on the page. The gifs will animate once clicked on and stop animating once clicked again.

A couple of the main focuses of this project were using jQuery to maniuplate the DOM as well as using ajax for calls to the Giphy API. Handling async operations and promises was important in getting the page to function appropriately.
